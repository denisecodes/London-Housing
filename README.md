## Introduction

The idea of this project came from after I came across a Los Angeles Rental Pricing Dashboard made by Diane, you can find it <a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/project/472">here</a>. I moved to London in the summer of 2021 and have aspirations to settle down in the city and buy a property here in the future. So I decided to do this project to help myself, my friends and anyone else interested to buy a property in the near future.

<b>The aim of this project is to see analyze the following:</b>
<ul>
<li>Relationship between Average Housing Price and Houses Sold from 1995 to 2020</li>
<li>The Median Salary and Average Housing Price by Borough from 1995 to 2020</li>
<li>Average Housing Price change from 1995 to 2020</li>
<li>Median Salary in London from 1995 to 2020</li>
</ul>

## Data Cleaning

<b>To set up the analysis and data visulization, I did the following to clean up the data:</b>
<ul>
<li>Filtered out locations that were specific to London i.e. Scotland, Wales, England, United Kingdom etc.</li>
</ul>
